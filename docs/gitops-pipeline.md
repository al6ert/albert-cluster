# GitOps and CI/CD Pipeline

This document describes the GitOps approach and CI/CD pipeline implemented in this project.

## GitOps Architecture

This repository follows GitOps principles where:

- **Git is the single source of truth** for all infrastructure and application configurations
- **Argo CD** continuously monitors the repository and automatically syncs changes to the cluster
- **Declarative configuration** is used throughout the project
- **Infrastructure as Code** is implemented with Kubernetes manifests and Helm charts

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized to support GitOps workflows:

- `infra/bootstrap/` - Contains manifests to install Argo CD and the root application
- `infra/apps/` - Applications managed by Argo CD (Traefik, CRDs, etc.)
- `infra/envs/` - Environment-specific values (minikube for local, netcup for production)
- `infra/charts/` - Custom Helm charts for applications

## CI/CD Pipeline

The project includes a comprehensive CI/CD pipeline with the following stages:

### Pipeline Stages

1. **Validate & Lint** - YAML syntax validation and linting
2. **Security Scan** - Vulnerability scanning with Trivy
3. **Build & Push** - Docker image building and publishing
4. **Testing** - Unit tests and integration tests with kind
5. **Deploy Staging** - Deployment to staging environment
6. **Deploy Production** - Deployment to production environment
7. **Verify** - Post-deployment verification
8. **Notify** - Status notifications

### Pipeline Features

- ✅ **Automatic validation** of YAML syntax and Helm charts
- ✅ **Security scanning** with Trivy
- ✅ **Unit and integration tests** with kind
- ✅ **Automatic deployment** to staging and production
- ✅ **Continuous monitoring** of the cluster
- ✅ **Semantic versioning** automation
- ✅ **Status notifications**

## Workflow Triggers

The pipeline is triggered by:

- **Push to main branch** - Deploys to production
- **Push to dev branch** - Deploys to staging
- **Pull requests** - Runs validation and tests
- **Releases** - Triggers full pipeline

## Security Features

- **Vulnerability scanning** with Trivy on every commit
- **Secret management** with proper .gitignore exclusions
- **RBAC** configured for Argo CD
- **Network policies** for pod-to-pod communication

## Monitoring and Observability

The pipeline includes:

- **Application health checks** post-deployment
- **Resource monitoring** and alerting
- **Log aggregation** and analysis
- **Performance metrics** collection

## Rollback Strategy

In case of deployment issues:

1. **Automatic rollback** through Argo CD
2. **Manual rollback** via Git revert
3. **Health check failures** trigger automatic rollback
4. **Monitoring alerts** for quick response

## Best Practices

- **Immutable tags** for Docker images
- **Declarative configuration** only
- **Environment parity** between staging and production
- **Infrastructure testing** before deployment
- **Documentation** updated with every change
